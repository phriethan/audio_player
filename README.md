# audio_player
This project is an audio player developed using Embedded C on the Altera MAX10 FPGA platform. It demonstrates the functionality of playing audio 
files stored on an external memory device (SD card) and outputs audio through a digital-to-analog converter (DAC). The project is 
optimized for low-latency audio playback and uses custom hardware interfaces implemented in Verilog to handle audio data streaming and signal 
processing.
